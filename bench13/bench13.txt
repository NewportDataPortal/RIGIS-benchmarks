  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data contains a set of geodetic control stations maintained by the National Geodetic Survey in the state of Rhode Island. Each geodetic control station in this dataset has either a precise Latitude/Longitude used for horizontal control or a precise Orthometric Height used for vertical control, or both. This dataset represents all geodetic control stations throughout the state of Rhode Island. 
      The National Geodetic Survey (NGS) serves as the Nation's depository for geodetic data. The NGS distributes geodetic data worldwide to a variety of users. These geodetic data include the final results of geodetic surveys, software programs to format, compute, verify, and adjust original survey observations or to convert values from one geodetic datum to another, and publications that describe how to obtain and use Geodetic Data products and services.
    Purpose: Provide a base of reference for latitude, longitude and height throughout the Rhode Island.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Horizontal control stations (those with precise Latitude, Longitude) were established in accordance with FGDC publications "Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Accuracy Standards" and "Geometric Geodetic Accuracy Standards and Specifications for Using GPS Relative Positioning Techniques." The final Latitude, Longitude of these stations were determined by a least squares adjustments of the horizontal observations. Horizontal control station have Latitude, Longitudes displayed to 5 places and are identified by attribute POS_SRCE = 'ADJUSTED'
      Lesser quality Latitude, Longitudes may also be preset in the dataset. These are identified by a POS_SRCE attributes HD_HELD1, HD_HELD2, or SCALED. These lesser quality positions are described at: <http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_lookup.prl?Item=SCALED>
      Vertical control stations (those with precise Orthometric Heights) were established in accordance with FGDC publications "Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Accuracy Standards." The final Orthometric Height of these stations were in most cases determined by a least squares adjustments of the vertical observations but in some cases may have been keyed from old survey documents. Vertical control stations have Orthometric Heights displayed to 2 or 3 places and are identified by attribute ELEV_SRCE of ADJUSTED, ADJ UNCH, POSTED,READJUST,N HEIGHT,RESET,COMPUTED
      Lesser quality Orthometric Heights may also be preset in the dataset. These are identified by a ELEV_SRCE attributes GPS_OBS, VERT_ANG, H_LEVEL, VERTCON, SCALED. These lesser quality orthometric heights are described at:
      <http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_lookup.prl?Item=SCALED>
      IMPORTANT - Control stations do not always have both precise Latitude, Longitude AND precise Orthometric Height. A horizontal control station may have a orthometric height associated with it which is of non geodetic quality. These types of heights are displayed to 0, 1, or 2 decimal places.  Worst case being off by +/- 1 meter. LIKEWISE - A Vertical control station may have a Latitude, Longitude associated with it which is of non geodetic quality. These types of Latitude, Longitudes are displayed to 0, 1 or 2 decimal places.  Worst case being off by +/- 180 meter. Refer to <http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_lookup.prl?Item=SCALED> for a description of the various type of methods used in determining the Latitude, Longitude, and Orthometric Height.
      Attribute POS_CHECK and ELEV_CHECK indicate whether or not an observational check was made to the position and/or orthometric height. Care should be taken when using "No Check" coordinates.
      If attribute ELEV_SRCE = 'VERTCON' then the Orthometric Height was determined by applying NGS program VERTCON to an Old NGVD 29 height. In most areas VERTCON gives results to +/- 2 cm. See <http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Vertcon/vertcon.html> for a more detailed explanation of VERTCON accuracy.
      Ellipsoid Heights are also present in the dataset. The ellipsoid heights consist of those determined using a precise geoid model, which are displayed to 2 decimal places and are considered good to +/- .005 meters, and those displayed to 1 decimal place and are considered only good to +/- .5 meters
    Quantitative_Attribute_Accuracy_Assessment:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Value: 95 percent confidence level for geodetic quality data.
      Attribute_Accuracy_Explanation:

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The National Geodetic Survey produces geodetic data. Geodetic data comprise the results of geodetic surveys to determine, among other things, latitude, longitude, height, scale, and orientation control. The National Geodetic Survey original field survey project observations and final reports are accessioned into records system of the National Archives and Records Administration of the U.S.A. These surveys provide information valuable for a variety of uses in the mapping, charting and surveying community.
        The NGS' final products are the geodetic data sheets available via http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/datasheet.prl. Geodetic data sheets are comprehensive summaries of all published information for a given geodetic reference point, including: the geographic position and/or height based on the current reference datum, condition of the survey mark when it was last visited, a description of where the point is located and how to reach it, and an explanation of the terms used in the data sheet. In support of these geodetic data, the NGS provides software, publications, and various user services, including geodetic advisor program, instrument calibration, surveying standards, and technical workshops.
        This dataset contains certain information extracted from the above mentioned collection of geodetic data sheets.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Geodetic data for all 5 Rhode Island counties (Bristol, Kent, Newport, Providence and Washington) downloaded from http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/datasheet.prl >> ShapeFiles >> COUNTY >> RHODE ISLAND. Each individual county was then selected (5 times total). All survey stations for each county were exported to a shapefile. 
        Once downloaded these 5 shapefiles were brought into ArcMap 10.2 and re-projected to the Rhode Island State Plane (feet) coordinate system and merged together into one statewide shapefile.
        An all-encompassing metadata record was created for the new statewide dataset of geodetic survey control points for Rhode Island prior to contributing this data to RIGIS for distribution.

        Distribution rate for POSTED and READJUSTED benchmarks which do not have an Order and Class are as follows "Posted bench marks" are vertical control points in the NGS data base which were excluded from the NAVD 88 general adjustment. Some of the bench marks were excluded due to large adjustment residuals, possibly caused by vertical movement of the bench marks during the time interval between different leveling epochs. Adjusted NAVD 88 are computed for posted bench marks by supplemental adjustments.
        A range of mean distribution rate corrections is listed for each posted bench mark in the data portion of the publication. A summary table of the mean distribution rates and their codes is listed below.  The mean distribution rate corrections which were applied to the original leveling observations is a good indication of the usefulness of the posted bench marks' adjusted NAVD 88 heights.

            The ellipsoid height difference accuracy (b) is computed from a minimally constrained correctly weighted least squares adjustment
            by - b = s / sqrt(d)
            where:
            b = height difference accuracy
            s = propagated standard deviation of ellipsoid height
            difference in millimeters between control points
            obtained from the least squares adjustment.
            d = horizontal distance between control points in kilometers
